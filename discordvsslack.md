| Categorization       | Slack has threads, which are admittedly efficient but also get messy easily                   | Discord has channel categories which don't move when people post and can have roles applied to them easily
| Roles                | Slack *probably* has a permission system in some form, but I don't really know                | Discord has an efficient and intuitive permission system, which allows anyone to see your roles and allows you to grant access to channels/categories separately as well as with a blanket role. Roles are created by the owner (and other appointed administrators) and are unlimited in number. As a side note, you can add a role color, which is quite useful for distinction, and you can manage how roles and individual people work per channel in channel settings |
| Activity system      | Slack has a fair activity system, where you can see peoples active-or-not by clicking on them | Discord has an activity bar on the right, and four different possible activity states which change automatically. Green means you are active, yellow means you are idle, red means you are do-not-disturb, grey means you are not on. These can be set by the person as well as automatically and are quite intuitive. |
| Polling              | Slack has threads, which work for polling quite well                                          | Discord has a number of photogenic emoji that can be used as "reactions" very easily |
| Security             | Slack has some security, which is useful, but is not end-to-end encrypted.                    | Discord has similar security, and although I didn't do full research on this, I know it uses HTTPS |
| Direct messaging     | Slack has better direct messaging, which is workspace-based                                   | Discord's direct messaging is similar to Slack, but not server-oriented. |
| Status system        | Slack has fairly good custom statuses                                                         | Until recently, Discord did not have custom statuses, but could be hacked. Its primary method for statuses is based on a list of the running applications, and is optimized for video games. |
| Emoji                | Slack has custom emoji, and fairly good primary ones, and an easy emoji access method         | Discord is about the same |
| Integration          | Slack has apps, which I've not messed with.                                                   | Discord has an easy bot api and webhooks, which work very well with Github and others. |
